# Snake Py
A classic snake mini-game created with Python 3 and Turtle module following object-oriented programming.

# Controls
Use arrow keys to change the direction of where the snake is going.

# Objective
To get as many scores as you can. But bear in mind that for every food that the snake eats, its speed and length increases. The game stops when the snake's head hit the edges of the screen or its body.
